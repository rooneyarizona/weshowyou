        We Show You was first created in 2023 as a provider of short
        demonstration videos. While many other online video streaming providers
        exist (with some fabulous content) it became apparent that scrolling
        through hour long tutorials is, well, boring!
      </p>
      <p className="mainTextContent">
        And so We Show You was born! After a revamp in 2024 using ReactJS
        (demonstration coming soon ðŸ˜‰) the site is now live and ready for YOU
        (to show us).
