        <h1>5 Minutes - Max!</h1>
        We Show You was first created in 2023 as a provider of short
        demonstration videos. While many other online video streaming providers
        exist (with some fabulous content) it became apparent that scrolling
        through hour long tutorials is, well, boring!
      </p>
      <p className="mainTextContent">
        And so We Show You was born! We (well, actually you) provide
        demonstration videos that are under 5 Minutes! We look foward to seeing
        what you've got!
